<h2 class="hidden sm:block">Welcome to the Pennsylvania Army</h2>
<h2 class="block sm:hidden">Welcome, Recruit!</h2>
<p class="p m-1" style="text-indent: 1em;">The Pennsylvania Army is a non-historically accurate European / North American community.
    We do private events on the weekend, ranging from line battles to normal skirmishes. We are a lax regiment in
    regards to attendance, but serious when it comes
    to gameplay.</p>

<p class="p m-1" style="text-indent: 1em;">Why should you join us? We aren’t special in regards to anyone else, same events, same
    days, but we have a unique and crazy playstyle, and we have an amazing community with an interesting mix of your
    average epic gamer, to military veterans and in-service
    members.
